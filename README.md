The Project:
Steps in building the Anand's Tic-Tac-Toe app.

Step 1: what is the app going to look like and what will it do:


There will be a sign up space where the user will be required to register if they are new.

There will also be a sign in space for user to sign in after they have registered.

The app will also have a sign out button, so that users can sign out when done.

There will be a 'New Game' button to clear the board and a 'Click to Start Game' button, which allows the user to begin a game.

Above the 'Click to Start Game' button the results of the game will be displayed.

To play more games the user has to click the 'New Game' button and they can continue to play as long as they like.

When the user is finished playing they can end by using the 'sign Out' button.
